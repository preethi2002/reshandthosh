As a Front-end Developer, I have received and understood the task for the "Game Core Engine & Score API" project.

---

### **Frontend Task Analysis & Execution Plan**

**Project Name:** Game Core Engine & Score API
**Project Category:** Game Development
**Frontend Task Summary:** Implement Game UI, Animations, and Core Movement
**Description:** Develop and integrate all user interface (UI) components. Implement character movement logic, animations, and collision detection effects. Ensure the frontend delivers a smooth and responsive gameplay experience.
**Assignee:** UserA

**Understanding the Task:**
This task requires me to build the interactive user-facing part of the game. Key areas of focus will be:

1.  **User Interface (UI) Components**: Designing and implementing all visual elements the player interacts with or sees (e.g., game canvas, player character, score display, health bars, game over screens, menus, buttons).
2.  **Character Movement Logic**: Writing the code that allows the player's character to move within the game world, typically controlled by keyboard or mouse input. This includes defining movement speed, boundaries, and potentially different movement states (e.g., walking, running, jumping).
3.  **Animations**: Bringing the game to life through visual effects. This includes character animations (idle, walk, jump), UI animations (button hovers, pop-ups), and environmental animations. This might involve CSS animations, JavaScript-driven sprite animations, or using a game library's animation system.
4.  **Collision Detection Effects**: Implementing the logic to detect when game objects (player, enemies, obstacles, pickups) overlap. Upon detection, specific effects or game logic should be triggered (e.g., player takes damage, item collected, boundary hit).
5.  **Smooth and Responsive Gameplay**: Optimizing performance to ensure the game runs at a consistent frame rate, responds quickly to player input, and provides a fluid user experience.

**Proposed Technology Stack (for a web-based game):**

*   **HTML5**: For structuring the game canvas and any static UI elements.
*   **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and implementing declarative animations (e.g., transitions, keyframe animations).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For core game logic, input handling, state management, dynamic UI updates, and controlling complex animations.
*   **(Optional for larger projects)**: A game framework/library like Phaser, PixiJS, or a modern JavaScript framework (React/Vue) for complex UI layers outside the main game canvas. For this basic demonstration, vanilla JavaScript will suffice.

### **Frontend Code Example: Basic Game Core (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**

Below is a simplified code example demonstrating the implementation of basic UI, core movement, and a placeholder for animations and collision detection using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**1. `index.html` (HTML Structure)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Game Core Engine - Frontend</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game-container">
        <div id="player"></div>
        <div id="score-display">Score: 0</div>
        <!-- Simple obstacle for collision demonstration -->
        <div class="obstacle" id="obstacle1"></div>
    </div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**2. `style.css` (CSS for Styling and Basic Animation)**

```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    overflow: hidden; /* Hide scrollbars if game is larger than viewport */
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    background-color: #333;
    font-family: 'Press Start 2P', cursive, Arial, sans-serif; /* A retro font would be cool */
    color: white;
}

#game-container {
    width: 800px;
    height: 600px;
    background-color: #222;
    border: 3px solid #0f0;
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden; /* Ensure player stays within bounds */
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5);
}

#player {
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    background-color: #007bff; /* Player color */
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%; /* Initial position, centered */
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* Adjust for actual center */
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: background-color 0.1s ease-out; /* Smooth color change for movement animation */
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.7);
}

#player.moving {
    background-color: #0056b3; /* Darker blue when moving */
    transform: scale(1.05) translate(-50%, -50%); /* Slight scale effect when moving */
}

#score-display {
    position: absolute;
    top: 15px;
    left: 15px;
    font-size: 1.5em;
    z-index: 10;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px #000;
}

.obstacle {
    width: 60px;
    height: 60px;
    background-color: #ff0000; /* Red obstacle */
    position: absolute;
    top: 150px; /* Example fixed position */
    left: 200px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7);
    transition: background-color 0.2s ease;
}
```

**3. `script.js` (JavaScript for Game Logic)**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const player = document.getElementById('player');
    const gameContainer = document.getElementById('game-container');
    const scoreDisplay = document.getElementById('score-display');
    const obstacle1 = document.getElementById('obstacle1'); // Get the obstacle

    // Game state variables
    // Initial player position, relative to gameContainer
    let playerX = gameContainer.offsetWidth / 2 - player.offsetWidth / 2;
    let playerY = gameContainer.offsetHeight / 2 - player.offsetHeight / 2;
    const playerSpeed = 4; // Pixels per frame
    let score = 0;

    // Keyboard input state
    const keysPressed = {};

    // Function to update player's visual position
    function renderPlayer() {
        player.style.left = `${playerX}px`;
        player.style.top = `${playerY}px`;
    }

    // Update player position based on input
    function updatePlayerMovement() {
        let moved = false;
        if (keysPressed['ArrowUp'] || keysPressed['KeyW']) {
            playerY = Math.max(0, playerY - playerSpeed);
            moved = true;
        }
        if (keysPressed['ArrowDown'] || keysPressed['KeyS']) {
            playerY = Math.min(gameContainer.offsetHeight - player.offsetHeight, playerY + playerSpeed);
            moved = true;
        }
        if (keysPressed['ArrowLeft'] || keysPressed['KeyA']) {
            playerX = Math.max(0, playerX - playerSpeed);
            moved = true;
        }
        if (keysPressed['ArrowRight'] || keysPressed['KeyD']) {
            playerX = Math.min(gameContainer.offsetWidth - player.offsetWidth, playerX + playerSpeed);
            moved = true;
        }

        // Apply "moving" class for CSS animation/styling
        if (moved) {
            player.classList.add('moving');
        } else {
            player.classList.remove('moving');
        }
    }

    // Simple AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection
    function checkCollision(obj1, obj2) {
        const rect1 = obj1.getBoundingClientRect();
        const rect2 = obj2.getBoundingClientRect();

        return (
            rect1.left < rect2.right &&
            rect1.right > rect2.left &&
            rect1.top < rect2.bottom &&
            rect1.bottom > rect2.top
        );
    }

    // Handle collision effects
    function handleCollisions() {
        if (checkCollision(player, obstacle1)) {
            // Collision detected with obstacle!
            if (!player.dataset.collided) { // Only trigger once per collision
                console.log("Player collided with obstacle!");
                score = Math.max(0, score - 10); // Example: deduct score
                scoreDisplay.textContent = `Score: ${score}`;
                obstacle1.style.backgroundColor = '#ffc107'; // Change obstacle color
                player.dataset.collided = 'true'; // Mark player as collided
                // More advanced effects: play sound, push player back, etc.
            }
        } else {
            // No collision with obstacle
            if (player.dataset.collided) {
                obstacle1.style.backgroundColor = '#ff0000'; // Reset obstacle color
                delete player.dataset.collided; // Clear collision flag
            }
        }
    }

    // The main game loop
    function gameLoop() {
        updatePlayerMovement(); // Update player logic
        handleCollisions();     // Check and resolve collisions
        renderPlayer();         // Update player's visual position

        // Request next frame for smooth animation
        requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
    }

    // Event listeners for keyboard input
    document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
        keysPressed[e.code] = true;
        // Prevent default browser actions for common game keys (e.g., scrolling)
        if (['ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight', 'Space', 'KeyW', 'KeyA', 'KeyS', 'KeyD'].includes(e.code)) {
            e.preventDefault();
        }
    });

    document.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {
        keysPressed[e.code] = false;
    });

    // Initial setup: render player at start position, update score display
    renderPlayer();
    scoreDisplay.textContent = `Score: ${score}`;

    // Start the game loop
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
});
```

**How to run this code:**

1.  Save the HTML code as `index.html`.
2.  Save the CSS code as `style.css` in the same directory.
3.  Save the JavaScript code as `script.js` in the same directory.
4.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
5.  Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move the blue player square. You will see it change color slightly when moving, and if it touches the red obstacle, the score will decrease, and the obstacle will change color.
